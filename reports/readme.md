# Report Template

Every time a hunt is conducted a report should be created/updated. 

**If this is the first time this hunt has been ran...**
1. Copy the report template below (everything in the gray box)
2. Create a new file in the reports directory with the name of the hunt
3. Fill in the information and save the report (remember to copy the UUID from the hunt abstract)

**If there is already a report...** 
1. Add a new section with the date at the top and copy the 4 questions from above
2. Increment the Incidents, Countermeasures, and Recommendations if there are any
```
